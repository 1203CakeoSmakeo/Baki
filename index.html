        <h1>What is the anime series Baki</h1>
        Baki is a anime series that was made from the Japanese Manga artist himself Keisuke Itagki, what inspired Keisuke the most when making this anime was his former love for amateur boxing in the past,everyday Keisuke would go to his local boxing ring to practice his skills in hand to hand combat and since he was a manga artist he decided that it would be cool and will also excite many people if he made a anime based on fighting and martial arts techniques.And to be honest what I love about this anime and Keisuke work is that, he uses real life martial arts techniques,he uses real life info on how the body works and where most of your strength come from, and also what makes it amazing is that he nevers inputs anything syfy or kinda out of the logic of this anime because his main objective of this anime is to not just intrigue people on fighting but on how cool it is to learn martial arts and how significant it can be useful in real life for certian people who want to learn martial any type of arts. But what really make this anime one of the best is that 90% of the characters in it are based off real life people and those people that you search up on google make you say to yourself,"no wonder these amazing characters are based off such amazing people". So to explain more to you about baki it started out first in 2001 this was when the anime version of the manga came out and many people where dying to see episode after episode. Season 2 started in 2002 one year after season 1 amazing am I right. And now we have Season 3 which is known to us now Baki 2018 which starts off showing off all the characters from the very first season to present time itself. And to make it better this season circle around every character as if each one is its own main chracter which made it even cooler for the series because fans were excited to see into the lives of all the main charcter and to also see what there past was like.
       
        <h1>Yuichiro Hanma</h1>
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NRQwnFCeuts/WJaJ9u-m-gI/AAAAAAAAMuQ/vZZR4nhlfpEd7aQQx437hAkiWAwKe5FWQCJoC/w530-h884-n-rw/1752982847981086880%253Faccount_id%253D1">
        <h3>Apperance</h3>
        Yuichiro is a very large muscular man with exceptionally large broad shoulders noted by many not to be considered human. He has dark colored hair that he ties in a simple ponytail. Like many men in the Hanma bloodline he has the "demon" on his back muscles. Yuichiro also have cauliflower ears due to his grappling battles.
        <h3>Personality</h3>
        Not much is known about Yuichiro's personality, but it is noted from Tokugawa that he is the complete opposite of Yujiro, implying that maybe he is a lot kinder than him, as shown when he supports Baki in the fight against his father much to Yujiro's anger. Also, Yuichiro seems to be a quite carefree and calm person. This may be considered as a one of the reasons why Yujiro is being so harsh on Baki since he reminds Yujiro of his own father.There is evidence that shows he can be rather ruthless shown during the battle of Okinawa when Yuichiro is seen fighting and brutally beating the American soldiers in a most gruesome way(twisted necks, broken bones,and more stuff that you might want to censor.)
        <h3> Abilities </h3>
        The true depths of Yuichiro's strength is still currently unknown, but those who've come across him suggest he is inhumanly strong. As such shown in the battle of Okinawa to be the only other man in the world besides his son to singlehandedly defeat the USA during WWII. It is unknown if Yuichiro is stronger than Yujiro, but there's speculation this is the only man Yujiro cannot defeat.

Yuichiro is only known to use one technique to defeat one thousand US soldiers on the battleship Iowa. Many of the soldiers call this technique "dress" only for Yujiro to correct it by stating the real technique was really called "guise" the user uses his opponent as a human weapon like a "nunchuku" surrounding himself in a spiritual image that looks like a dress.

When Doppo Orochi started to fight him, he ends up possibly breaking Yuichiro's jaw. This hints that Yuichiro might in fact be weaker than his son (Yujiro tanked attacks way more brutal than a kick to the jaw without being harmed) However, it is unknown if Yuichiro simply let Doppo attack him as a way of testing Doppo's strength.
<h3>Reference</h3>
The character is probably based on the real-life Japanese judoka and professional wrestler, Masahiko Kimura. To consider that Yuichiro was based on Kimura, it is quite possible that Yuichiro lost a prizefight on purpose to earn treatment fees for his ill wife.
        <h1>Yujiro Hanma</h1>
        <img src="https://pic2.taadd.com/comics/pic4/28/23516/496280/HanmaBaki2790234.jpg"style=" width: 400px; height: 600px">
        <h3>Apperance</h3>
        Yujiro is a built man standing 6'5 and weighing 300 pounds (195.58 cm and weighing 136 kg). Yujiro has red wavy hair, thick black eyebrows and red eyes. although Yujiro isn't as much overmuscular as some other characters and has a more athletic flame, his abnormal muscles take   the shape of a demon when he gets serious in a fight.  He is usually shown wearing his signature dark red shirt and pants in the anime and black shirt and pants in the manga, though he is also shown wearing a black shirt and pants in the third season of the anime.

As a teenager, he wore a green soldier outfit and a green bandana. He later adopts a ponytail for a short while, eventually leading to his present hairstyle. Yujiro's appearance can be likened to that of an ogre or lion (as this was Keisuke Itagaki's intention).
<h3>Personality</h3>
Yujiro is a very cruel and arrogant man. He shows no mercy towards anybody, as he views mercy as a "weak" trait. Yujiro is also known to be emotionally manipulative - this can be seen in his relationships with his son and Emi Akezawa, for example. He seemingly lives only to fight and cause destruction to anything and everything he can. His whole life and mindset is dedicated to nothing but fighting and growing stronger with each person he defeats, sometimes killing them. He tends to kill people if pushed or enraged enough, and does not show care or remorse when doing so. He will also kill for pleasure or satisfaction when he feels like it. He has a deep resentment for those who are weak, and does not even think it's worth killing them. He desires for his son Baki to become strong like him, so he can enjoy a challenging fight with him, as if Baki is a toy to him.For me people see Yujiro as a cruel father but I just see it as his own way as teaching son about life.
<h3>Abilities</h3>
So this is going to be pretty long and trust me when I say long I mean long.Yujiro is the strongest character in the series, with his strength being said to equal that of an entire army or more.Yujiro was able to defeat the American military forces by himself during the time of the Vietnam War; Yujiro was 16 at the time. Some of Yujiro's greatest feats of strength include, pushing back 100 riot police, completely stopping the tectonic activity of an earthquake by punching the ground, tapping craters in concrete walls, easily knocking out a giant elephant that not even tanks could damage, and cutting glass apart with his fingers,and crushing coal into dust. It is said that Yujiro's hits are equivalent to that of a nuclear impact, with even entire armies trying their best weapons to stop him, but to no effect. His body's muscles are so strong and durable to the point, that he is able to do things like breaking samurai swords and knives by gripping them, walking through bulletproof-glass walls, and shaking skyscrapers by merely making his muscles tense (it is implied that it is actually his body's aura). Another indication of his strength would also be his durability, (as durability and strength are in consistency with each other). Yujiro is durable enough to take a full impact hit from literally anything or anyone on Earth, without even flinching or being damaged whatsoever. He was shown to not be injured at all after falling from the top of a 50 story skyscraper. He has also never been shown once to actually have been hurt from any character who has hit him in the entire series until Kaku Kaoih, who used the power of his own punches against him, causing him to bleed, or when Baki activates his demon back to make him feels pain. Yujiro was shown to effortlessly overpower with just his fingers the likes of Oliva, who is strong enough to cause an interference in the GPS signal in cars all over the planet with a punch to the ground. His body is durable enough to tank things like bullets, fire, lightning strikes, blades, diseases of any kind, cannonballs, and even missiles, with none of these being able to even penetrate his skin or injure him at all. Yujiro was able to easily move at bullet-timer speeds when he was just 16.Yujiro was shown to catch a 45 lb arrow that required 200 kgs of force to successfully project, and caught before it could leave the bowstrings from 9 ft away. He is shown to move at warp-like speeds, that are imperceptible to other characters vision, almost as if teleporting. He is able to easily out-manuever any character in the series in terms of pure speed; with characters who are at mid - top tier level being able to traverse across hundreds of miles in a matter of hours on foot. He can strike with enough velocity that can break the sound barrier and rip through the air, causing extremley intense gusts of wind. When Yujiro flexes his latissimus dorsi muscles, his back takes the shape of a demon's face, thus increasing his strength and combat abilities. Yujiro is constantly advancing his strength, becoming stronger with each person he defeats everyday, essentially "devouring" them, as he himself tends to say, all the while his "demon back" is exposed. A genius fighter he is known to have mastered all forms of unarmed combat. His repertoire apparently includes all of the well known fighting styles (such as karate, boxing, taekwondo, jujutsu, wrestling, street-fighting, and so on) as well as some more esoteric ones (such as the udonde or uzunde style, an actual system used in the Motobu-ryu of karate). Since the age of sixteen, he has been fighting on the battlefields using just his bare hands, when he fought against both American and Vietcong in the Vietnam War. Since then, it appears he has obtained respect from the American forces, even going so far as them declaring amnity towards him with each new president. Yujiro also has a complete and full understanding of the human body and its anatomy, and essentially has complete medical knowledge on each organ and muscle and their respective function. It should be noted as well that, Yujiro has the extraordinary ability to instantly learn and master a fighting style perfectly, upon the first time seeing it.Now tell me isn't that dude amazing.
<h3>Reference</h3>
His appearance at debut was based on Matt Dillon. However, his appearance in later parts of the manga appears to take after Paul Stanley.
Yujiro is a secret unlockable character in the video game Garouden Breakblow: Fist or Twist. His hair is blue rather than red.
<h3>Jack Hanma</h3>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N-GLhgOBOb0/XAm_USXQWsI/AAAAAAAABpw/f7g-WA7m7F4ImCop_vVB0LxzoiAPHgAkQCJoC/w600-h1023/gplus1635268728.jpg">
<h3>Apperance</h3>
Jack trained so hard that his muscles became completely destroyed. He took an experimental drug known as the x4 to strengthen his body, regardless of a scientist warning it might kill him, he underwent extreme pain from the drug surviving due only to his hanma blood line, the drug caused his muscles to become extremely large and strong. Unfortunately, an amount of drugs eventually managed to destroy his body again, and drastically reducing his life expectancy in the process. But later, Jack managed to repair his body and he became even stronger. In the second series of the manga, he underwent surgery to made him taller and stronger. Kureha Shinogi carried out the operation, and thanks to that fact the desired effect was achieved. Kanji Igari stated that Jack is even bigger than Mount Toba.
<h3>Personality</h3>
Jack's driving force is wanting to defeat his father, Yujiro Hanma, to avenge his mother who was raped by him. Jack turned into a monster without balance who only cares about becoming stronger to take revenge. It can be said that he is sometimes too confident in his strength. Trains too much for his body to handle, forcing him to resort to stereoids and other medical methods in order to keep his strength growing steadily. Is too obsessed with beating Yujiro and avenging his mother, to the point where he is blinded by that dream. He doesn't know a lot of techniques and often fights head-on.

He sees his brother, Baki Hanma, as a rival, but also likes and cares for him deep in his heart as they have the same goal in surpassing Yujiro. Jack also seems to have some feelings for his younger brother's girlfriend, Kozue. When he first meet her in the Maximum Tournament, he flirted with her. But maybe he did it only to provoke his brother.

Jack's intelligence is relatively average. Although he has shown himself to be a slightly bit of a combat genuis from times to times (as he was able to counter Shibukawa's Aiki), that is likely due to his lineage as a Hanma and the son of Yujiro Hanma.
<h3>History</h3>
Like his brother Baki, he has since childhood wished to surpass his father Yujiro Hanma in strength and martial ability. His obsession to defeat his hated father led to extreme over-training at various fighting gyms which led to the deterioration of the muscles in his body. He wasn't much more than skin and bones because his body had been damaged by overwork. For example, Jack would punch sandbags for over 12 hours without eating, resting, or even using the restroom and would lift weights until his body refused to do anymore. He claimed he will never be able to defeat his father with normal training. After his encounter with the Yujiro-inspired scientist named Dr. John who witnessed Yujiro killing a polar bear, the scientist promises him great results if he tries using a special drug which he called X-4. He received from him a concentrated formula of steroids to match his over-training and gained immense power in the process, though in the process Jack had become addicted to the drugs and began overdosing leaving him even more mentally unstable. Like Yujiro, he became powerful enough to kill a polar bear with his bare hands, but with his unstable mindset he was more brutal and made it's death agonizing.
<h3>Abilities</h3>
One of his main techniques is the biting, and he can bite hard enough to easily crush wood with his teeth. He claims that his teeth can tear a coconut. Jack could eat a whole roasted pig in 10 seconds and could chew on the bones of a T-bone steak like it was a biscuit, thanks to the amazing power of his teeth. Although he lost all of his teeth, his bite can still damage Izou Motobe when he wears chain mail made of Aramid fibres, which is made for planes and tires. His body is strong enough to surpass drugs, even though he used abnormal amounts of them.

His strength is shown many time in the story: killed a polar bear with his bare fists in the same way his father did, defeating the convict Sikorsky with a punch so strong he lifted the telephone box where they were located in that moment, and withstood his knuckle slash in the underground arena, taking many blows from Mohammad Alai Jr and defeating him, cutting Ali's tongue in the process, fighting with Pickle and making him run away in fear of the only creature that scares him, a wasp.

Despite using brute force to fight, Jack is a very tactical fighter, and is smart enough to counter and outmaneuver his opponents. For example, he made Chiharu Shiba pass out with a special type of a hold where Jack presses two fingers on the gang leader's vital points that are located in the throat (Baki defeated Gaia with a similar way; except that Baki did it with two hands, while Jack only used one hand) and also when he found the weakness of Aiki after being thrown many times and used a similar move to defeat Goki Shibukawa.
<h3>Reference</h3>
He is based on the legendary British professional wrestler Dynamite Kid.
